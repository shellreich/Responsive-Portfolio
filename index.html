  <div class="group">
   <div class="item-double">
    <p>My first exposure of web development was on a webTV in the 90's. Now I can utilize my creativity using my passion for creating websites. There are so many more options today for building websites. Check out my GitHub profile below to view my work.</p>
   <p>My past volunteer experience has been working in groups to build homes for Habitat for Humanity. That is such a rewarding experience to see so many people volunteer and work together to help others. Highly recommended for anyone looking for something meaningful to volunteer for.</p>
  <p >When not creating websites, I can be found: 
  
      Enjoying time with Family and Friends , Working with Essential Oils, and Metal Detecting</p>
